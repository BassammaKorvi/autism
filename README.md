• Building a model for autism screening is a promising 
approach to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, 
specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD 
screening process. To develop such a model, the 
proposed dataset related to autism screening of 
toddlers can be utilized, which contains ten 
behavioural features (Q-Chat-10) plus other individual 
characteristics that have proved to be effective in 
detecting ASD cases from controls.
• The model can take input from users by asking ten 
questions related to the child's behaviour and other 
relevant information such as sex and age. Using 
machine learning algorithms, the model can analyse
the input data and classify the child as either having 
ASD or not. The model can be trained using the 
proposed dataset, and various techniques such as 
feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning can 
be applied to optimize its performance.
