• Building a model for autism screening is a promising approach to improve the efficiency, sensitivity,specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD 
screening process. To develop such a model, the proposed dataset related to autism screening of toddlers can be utilized, which contains ten behavioural features (Q-Chat-10) plus other individual characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting ASD cases from controls.
• The model can take input from users by asking ten questions related to the child's behaviour and other relevant information such as sex and age. Using machine learning algorithms, the model can analysethe input data and classify the child as either having ASD or not. The model can be trained using the proposed dataset, and various techniques such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning can be applied to optimize its performance.

A2: How easy is it for you to get eye contact with your child?

A3: Does your child point to indicate that s/he wants something? (e.g. a toy that
is out of reach)

A4: Does your child point to share interest with you? (e.g. poin9ng at an
interes9ng sight)

A5: Does your child pretend? (e.g. care for dolls, talk on a toy phone)

A6: Does your child follow where you’re looking?

A7: If you or someone else in the family is visibly upset, does your child show
signs of wan9ng to comfort them? (e.g. stroking hair, hugging them)
